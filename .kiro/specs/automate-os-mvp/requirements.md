# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AutomateOS is a portfolio-defining workflow automation tool designed as a simplified, self-hosted clone of platforms like Zapier or n8n. The system enables users to create automated workflows using a trigger-action model where specific events initiate a series of tasks. The project targets developers, software engineers, startups, and software solopreneurs who need a personal "operating system" for their automation needs.

The MVP focuses on delivering a complete, end-to-end core loop within a 6-week timeline, emphasizing asynchronous processing, scalable architecture, and modern full-stack development practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely register and authenticate with the system, so that I can access my personal automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user provides valid registration details THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with hashed password storage
2. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token for authentication
3. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints with a valid JWT THEN the system SHALL allow access to their resources
4. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints without a valid JWT THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized error
5. IF a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL reject the login attempt with appropriate error messaging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to view and manage my workflows from a central dashboard, so that I can organize and control my automation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of their created workflows
2. WHEN a user clicks "Create New Workflow" THEN the system SHALL navigate them to the workflow editor
3. WHEN a user selects an existing workflow THEN the system SHALL allow them to view, edit, or delete that workflow
4. WHEN a user deletes a workflow THEN the system SHALL remove it from their dashboard and database
5. IF a user has no workflows THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with guidance to create their first workflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and configure workflows using a simple editor interface, so that I can define my automation logic without complex drag-and-drop interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the workflow editor THEN the system SHALL display a form-based interface for adding and configuring nodes
2. WHEN a user adds a new node THEN the system SHALL provide options for Webhook Trigger, HTTP Request, and Filter nodes
3. WHEN a user configures a node THEN the system SHALL validate the input parameters and provide feedback
4. WHEN a user saves a workflow THEN the system SHALL store the configuration as a JSON object in the database
5. WHEN a user loads an existing workflow THEN the system SHALL populate the editor with the saved configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to trigger workflows via webhooks, so that external services can initiate my automation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is saved with a webhook trigger THEN the system SHALL generate a unique webhook URL
2. WHEN an external service sends a POST request to the webhook URL THEN the system SHALL enqueue the workflow for execution
3. WHEN a webhook is triggered THEN the system SHALL immediately return HTTP 202 Accepted status
4. WHEN a workflow execution is enqueued THEN the system SHALL process it asynchronously using background workers
5. IF an invalid webhook URL is accessed THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 Not Found

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workflows to perform HTTP requests and apply conditional logic, so that I can integrate with external APIs and create dynamic automation flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow contains an HTTP Request node THEN the system SHALL execute the configured HTTP call with specified method, URL, headers, and body
2. WHEN a workflow contains a Filter node THEN the system SHALL evaluate the specified condition and continue execution only if the condition is met
3. WHEN an HTTP request fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and handle it gracefully without crashing the workflow
4. WHEN a filter condition is not met THEN the system SHALL stop workflow execution and log the result
5. WHEN nodes are chained together THEN the system SHALL execute them sequentially, passing data between nodes as configured

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view execution logs and history of my workflows, so that I can monitor their performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow executes THEN the system SHALL create an execution log entry with timestamp, status, and details
2. WHEN a user views workflow logs THEN the system SHALL display execution history with success/failure status
3. WHEN a workflow execution fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN a user accesses execution logs THEN the system SHALL show the most recent executions first
5. IF a workflow has never been executed THEN the system SHALL display an empty log state with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle concurrent workflow executions efficiently, so that the system remains responsive under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple workflows are triggered simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently using separate worker processes
2. WHEN the web server receives requests THEN it SHALL remain responsive regardless of background workflow execution time
3. WHEN a workflow takes a long time to execute THEN it SHALL not block other system operations
4. WHEN the task queue is full THEN the system SHALL handle new requests gracefully with appropriate status responses
5. IF a worker process fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other queued workflows without interruption

# Week 3 Logbook

## Day 1 - Monday, July 21, 2025

### Summary
Set up project foundation including frontend boilerplate and backend infrastructure with FastAPI.

### Completed Tasks

#### Frontend Setup
- [✓] Imported and edited boilerplate from previous project
  - Updated package.json with correct dependencies and scripts
  - Fixed tsconfig.json for Vite instead of Next.js
  - Created proper vite.config.ts and tsconfig.node.json
  - Updated scripts (dev, build, preview) for Vite workflow
  - Configured TypeScript for modern React development with proper paths
  - Set up Chakra UI integration
  - Maintained existing folder structure in src/ for components, contexts, hooks, services
- [✓] Committed initial "hello world" version

#### Development Environment
- [✓] Set up AI assistants (NotebookLM, Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- [✓] Created and activated Python virtual environment
  - Command: `source venv/Scripts/activate` (ensures packages install to project venv, not globally)

#### Backend Foundation
- [✓] Installed core dependencies
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" sqlmodel
  ```
- [✓] Created initial project structure
  ```
  AutomateOS/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   └── main.py
  └── requirements.txt 
  ```
- [✓] Implemented basic health check endpoint
  - Created FastAPI application in `app/main.py`
  - Added endpoint returning JSON message
- [✓] Successfully ran development server
  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  ```
  - Verified health check at http://127.0.0.1:8000
  - Tested FastAPI's interactive docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

#### Database Setup
- [✓] Defined core data models with SQLModel
  - Created User, Workflow, and ExecutionLog models
- [✓] Implemented database connection utilities
  - Created `database.py` with SQLite connection
  - Set up engine and table creation function
- [✓] Configured database initialization on application startup
  - Used FastAPI's lifespan context manager for proper startup/shutdown

### Pending Tasks
- [✅] Set up React project with Vite and Chakra UI
- [✅] Configure CORS middleware for local development

### Implementation Notes

#### Database Connection Setup
Created `database.py` with the following code:
```python
from sqlmodel import create_engine, SQLModel

# The database file will be named "database.db"
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///database.db"

# The engine is the main point of contact with the database
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, echo=True)

def create_db_and_tables():
    """
    Creates the database file and all tables based on SQLModel metadata.
    """
    SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

#### FastAPI Application Setup
Updated `main.py` to initialize database on startup:
```python
# AutomateOS main application file
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
from .database import create_db_and_tables

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Code to run on startup
    print("INFO:     Creating database and tables...")
    create_db_and_tables()
    yield
    # Code to run on shutdown (if any)
    print("INFO:     Application shutdown.")

app = FastAPI(
    title="AutomateOS",
    description="API for automating operating system tasks",
    version="0.1.0",
    lifespan=lifespan
)

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to AutomateOS API"}
```

#### Next Steps: CORS Configuration
Need to add CORS middleware to allow frontend-backend communication:
```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# CORS configuration
origins = [
    "http://localhost:5173",  # Default port for Vite React dev server
    "http://localhost:3000",  # Common alternative for React dev servers
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

## Day 2 - July 22 2025

````
With the frontend running, you've successfully set up both the backend and frontend environments.

You have now completed all the sub-tasks for the first major section of your plan: **Task 1: Project Foundation and Core Models**. This is a huge milestone.

-----

### Next Phase: Authentication System

According to your implementation plan, the next major task is **"2. Authentication System Implementation"**. We will start with the backend services first.

The first step is to create utilities for securely hashing and verifying passwords.

**Today's New Todo:**

1.  **Install Security Dependencies**

      * In your terminal for the **backend** (the one in the root `AutomateOS` directory), install `passlib` and `bcrypt`.
        ```bash
        pip install "passlib[bcrypt]"
        ```

2.  **Create a `security.py` File**

      * In your `app` directory, create a new file named `security.py`. This will hold all security-related functions.

3.  **Add Password Hashing Logic**

      * Add the following code to `app/security.py`. This sets up the context for hashing and provides functions to create and verify password hashes.
        ```python
        from passlib.context import CryptContext

        # Use bcrypt for hashing passwords
        pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=["bcrypt"], deprecated="auto")

        def verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool:
            """Verifies a plain password against a hashed one."""
            return pwd_context.verify(plain_password, hashed_password)

        def get_password_hash(password: str) -> str:
            """Hashes a plain password."""
            return pwd_context.hash(password)
        ```

This completes the first part of building your authentication system. You now have the necessary functions to handle passwords securely.

--Completed Tasks Summary--

````
✅ Completed Tasks:
1. Installed Security Dependencies: Successfully installed passlib[bcrypt] which provides secure password hashing capabilities
2. Created app/security.py: Added the security module with password hashing utilities
3. Implemented Password Hashing Functions:
  - get_password_hash(): Securely hashes plain text passwords using bcrypt
  - verify_password(): Verifies plain passwords against stored hashes
  - Used bcrypt algorithm with proper configuration for security

The implementation follows security best practices:
   - Uses bcrypt, which is specifically designed for password hashing
  - Includes salt generation automatically
  - Provides secure verification without exposing the original password
  - Uses the passlib library's CryptContext for proper configuration management

This completes the password hashing utilities portion of Task 2.1. The next steps in your authentication system would be to implement JWT token generation and validation functions, followed by the user registration and login endpoints.

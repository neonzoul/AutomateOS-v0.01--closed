### Task 6.1 Backend Logging System - Implementation Summary

**Implemented by:** Kiro Spec Mode (Claude Sonnet 3.5) - AI-assisted development through structured specification workflow

**Context:** This task was completed using Kiro's specification-driven development approach, where the AI agent systematically implemented the backend logging system according to the predefined requirements and design documents. The implementation followed the AutomateOS MVP specification for execution monitoring and audit trail capabilities.

#### ✅ Complete Implementation Summary

**Core Features Delivered:**
- **Execution Log Creation**: Automatic logging during workflow execution with comprehensive status tracking (running → success/failed)
- **History Retrieval**: RESTful API endpoints for accessing execution logs with proper JWT authentication and user isolation
- **Detailed Error Logging**: Complete error details, stack traces, and debugging information for failed workflow executions
- **Advanced Filtering**: Status-based filtering (success/failed/running) with robust pagination support for large datasets
- **Cleanup Utilities**: Both API endpoints and CLI tools for automated log maintenance and database optimization

**API Endpoints Added:**
- `GET /workflows/{workflow_id}/logs` - List execution logs with filtering and pagination
- `GET /logs/{log_id}` - Get detailed execution log information with full payload and result data
- `GET /workflows/{workflow_id}/logs/count` - Get total log count for pagination metadata
- `DELETE /logs/cleanup` - Clean up old execution logs with configurable retention periods

**CLI Utilities Created:**
- `python -m app.log_cleanup stats` - Show comprehensive execution log statistics
- `python -m app.log_cleanup cleanup --days 30` - Clean up logs older than specified days
- `python -m app.log_cleanup cleanup-status failed --days 7` - Clean up logs by specific status
- All utilities support `--dry-run` mode for safe testing

**Database & Schema Enhancements:**
- Enhanced `ExecutionLog` model with proper relationships and indexing
- Added `ExecutionLogPublic` and `ExecutionLogSummary` schemas for API responses
- Implemented efficient CRUD operations with ownership validation
- Added database constraints and foreign key relationships

**Security & Performance Features:**
- JWT authentication required for all logging endpoints
- User isolation - users can only access logs from their own workflows
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing and pagination
- Input validation and comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting considerations for cleanup operations

**Testing & Validation:**
- Created comprehensive test suite (`test_log_endpoints.py`) validating all endpoints
- Tested pagination, filtering, and authentication flows
- Validated both Redis and mock queue implementations
- Confirmed proper error handling and edge cases

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Integrated with existing workflow execution engine in both `queue.py` and `mock_queue.py`
- Added execution log creation during workflow runs with proper transaction handling
- Implemented cleanup utilities with configurable retention policies
- Enhanced both main application files (`main.py` and `main_no_redis.py`) with new endpoints
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing workflow execution flows

**Requirements Satisfied:**
- ✅ Requirement 6.1: Execution log creation during workflow runs
- ✅ Requirement 6.2: Execution history retrieval endpoints
- ✅ Requirement 6.3: Detailed execution log endpoint with error details
- ✅ Requirement 6.4: Execution status filtering and pagination
- ✅ Requirement 6.5: Log cleanup utilities for old executions

**Development Approach:**
This implementation showcased Kiro's specification-driven development methodology, where the AI agent:
1. Analyzed existing codebase architecture and patterns
2. Implemented features incrementally with proper testing
3. Maintained code quality and consistency with existing patterns
4. Provided comprehensive documentation and validation
5. Ensured security and performance best practices

The backend logging system is now fully functional and provides a solid foundation for the frontend implementation in Task 6.2, enabling comprehensive workflow execution monitoring and debugging capabilities for AutomateOS users.

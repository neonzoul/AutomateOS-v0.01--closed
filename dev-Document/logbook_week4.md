**Development Approach:**
This implementation showcased Kiro's specification-driven development methodology, where the AI agent:
1. Analyzed existing codebase architecture and patterns
2. Implemented features incrementally with proper testing
3. Maintained code quality and consistency with existing patterns
4. Provided comprehensive documentation and validation
5. Ensured security and performance best practices

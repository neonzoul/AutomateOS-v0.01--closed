# Sunday, 2025-07-20. : Today might be a holiday, but the reason I'm here is

    1.  Last night, I couldn't sleep because of the weather and my thoughts. I was sober, but I had an idea to deliver a proof-of-concept, Koryen v0.001 (built with a stack of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS), to test with Koryen. I saw their reaction after they realized their problem could be solved: they weren't even interested. Then, YouTube suggested something, and I accepted it. I took the advice to start with a clone project. Instead, I used Gemini for deep research. The project has changed, but the timeline has not. So, that's why I'm hereâ€”to transfer the boilerplate and progress from KoryenAlbCraft to a new project.

    2.  I love doing this. Don't believe me? Okay, I admit I'm feeling high on the idea, but I love programming, financial freedom, and the freedom of time and place. I really want to program because I'm a badass when I'm with a computer and the internet. This is my place. So, that's why I'm here.

This is the first time I've written about why I changed projects after the initial "hello, world" commit, which feels like breaking a promise. But actually, I don't think it is. Because I already delivered v0.001, I could see that the user's real problem wasn't what I had solved. The issue is that they "want to create it on their own."

So, I'm solving the problem by changing course as quickly as possible and moving to a project with more opportunity. On the other hand, this experiment successfully got a reaction and validated whether the perceived problem was real.

### My First(Real) Project: Goals and Context

I want to complete my first programming project to escape 'tutorial hell' and build something real.

**The Project's Goals:**

-   Learn by building, focusing on practical skills like problem-solving, software architecture, system design, API management, and documentation.
-   Ship a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that is strong enough to serve as a portfolio piece.
-   Prepare for the next phase: solving real-world problems for clients, such as freelancing for SMEs on platforms like Fastwork.

**My Background & Interests:**
Many people advise cloning popular apps, but my experience is more specific.

-   **Automation & APIs:** I'm an advanced Notion user who has built complex templates with relational databases and automations. I enjoy using tools like Make.com and have created AI chatbot flows and automations using APIs for Notion, Google Sheets, Drive, and Calendar.
-   **Open Source & Efficiency:** I plan to explore n8n because I'm passionate about open-source, the concept of "working lazy" (achieving better results with less effort through automation/AI), and the ability to own my workflows as code.
-   **Knowledge Base:** My passions include thinking, learning, games, philosophy, and now, programming. I also have knowledge in personal finance, investing, Bitcoin (economics, technology concept), and digital marketing.

**The Strategic Goal:**
I am a generalist aiming to become a specialist. My goal is to specialize in programming by integrating it with my existing knowledge, focusing on **APIs, AI agents, and automation** to solve productivity problems.

- Sunday 2025-07-20. to day might be holiday. 
but the reason that I'm here is.
1. Last night. I can't sleep because the weather, and my though.
    I'm sober thier but I have one though that I test deviver Koryen v0.001(build using vibe method with copilot stack JavaScript HTML CSS just for POC. ) to test to Koryen. I was see re action after they know maybe thier problem will gone, they not even intest. So, The Youtube send something to me and I accept it.
    And then I pick advise 1st clone project. I apply insteat, I use Gemini Deep Research 
    Project change but Time not. So, Why I'm here to tranfer boilerplate and progress from KoryenAlbCraft to Project n8n.
2. I love to. Don't believe?
    Ok, I admit I'm high but I love "Programming" "Money Freedom" "Time Place Freedom"
    I wantttttt to programming or just type something coz I'm a BAD ASS when I'm with computer and internet.
    ""This is my place""
    So, That Why I'm here.

This is my first time that I wrote why I change Project after commit "helo, world" = break promise.
But acctually I don't thinl that. Coz I already deliver even just v0.001 but can see that's not really problem.
They "Want to create with thier own" create it's not really problem.
But I solve the problem with change as fast as I can. move to Project that have more opportunity.
In the opasit side this work for find reaction to test that is real problem, or they not.

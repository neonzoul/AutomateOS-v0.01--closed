<!-- NotbookLM with Project MVP Deep Research Document. -->

Based on the project document, here are the key requirements and insights relevant for a Product Manager concerning the "AutomateOS" project:

### Project Vision & Goals
*   **Purpose:** To build a **portfolio-defining workflow automation tool**. It is envisioned as a "simplified, self-hosted clone of a workflow automation tool like Zapier or n8n".
*   **Strategic Importance:** The project is deliberately ambitious, designed to demonstrate a **nuanced understanding of full-stack development, asynchronous processing, and scalable system api base components architecture**, which are highly sought-after skills by employers. Unlike a standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, it inherently showcases a deeper grasp of software engineering principles.
*   **Motivation:** The project is driven by a passion for automation, APIs, and platforms like Notion, leveraging intrinsic interest to ensure successful completion.

### Product Identity & Target Audience
*   **Name:** AutomateOS (Modern & Tech-Focused).
*   **Positioning:** Positioned as a **personal "operating system" for all your automation**.
*   **Target Audience:** The tool is aimed at **Developers, Software Engineers (SEs), Start-Ups, and Software SoloPreneurs**.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope & Features (1.5-Month / 6-Week Timeline)
The MVP is aggressively constrained to ensure delivery of a **complete, end-to-end core loop** within 6 weeks, rather than replicating all features of commercial products.

*   **Key MVP Features:**
    *   **User Authentication:** A secure system for user registration and login.
    *   **Workflow Dashboard:** A central view where an authenticated user can see a list of their created workflows and initiate the creation of new ones.
    *   **Simplified Workflow Editor:** A **clean, form-based interface** for defining a workflow by chaining nodes. A complex drag-and-drop canvas is **explicitly out of scope for the MVP**. The editor will function more as a "JSON editor" for constructing the workflow definition.
    *   **One Trigger Node:** A **Webhook Trigger**, chosen for its versatility as a starting point for external service initiation.
    *   **Two Action Nodes:**
        *   An **HTTP Request Node**, serving as a fundamental building block for integration with any external API.
        *   A **Filter Node**, providing simple conditional logic (e.g., "only continue if X equals Y") for dynamic workflows.
    *   **Persistence and History:** The ability to save a configured workflow to the database and view a basic log of its past executions.

*   **Weekly Breakdown (High-Level):**
    *   **Week 1:** Project Setup & Core Models (User, Workflow, ExecutionLog).
    *   **Week 2:** Secure User Authentication (register/login, JWT).
    *   **Week 3:** Workflow CRUD & Dashboard (list workflows, create/read/update/delete).
    *   **Week 4:** Workflow Editor UI (load/save, basic node components).
    *   **Week 5:** Execution Engine (Webhook trigger, Redis/RQ for background tasks, display logs).
    *   **Week 6:** Deployment & Polish (to Render, UI/UX refinement, bug fixes).

### Core Architectural Principles
*   **Event-Driven Model:** The fundamental model is "WHEN a specific event occurs (a Trigger), DO a series of tasks (Actions)," inspired by Zapier and n8n.
*   **Decoupled Components:** The system emphasizes distinct, decoupled components: Editor UI (Frontend), Workflow Execution Engine (Backend), Nodes (Triggers/Actions), and a Database.
*   **Asynchronous Task Processing:** A **critical design decision** is the strict separation between the web server (handling user interactions) and the engine that executes potentially long-running workflow tasks. This is achieved using a **task queue (RQ/Redis)** and separate worker processes to ensure the API remains responsive and scalable.

### Technology Stack Choices
*   **Backend:**
    *   **FastAPI (Python):** Chosen for its high performance, developer-friendliness, built-in interactive API documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc), and robust dependency injection system.
    *   **SQLModel & Pydantic:** Used for elegant data modeling, combining Pydantic's data validation with SQLAlchemy's ORM for database interaction, reducing code duplication.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** The chosen production database for robustness. SQLite is used for local development.
    *   **RQ (Redis Queue):** Chosen over more complex alternatives like Celery for simplified asynchronous task processing, backed by Redis for message brokering.
    *   **JWT Authentication:** Modern, token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens following the OAuth2 Password Flow, with password hashing (passlib/bcrypt) and JWT creation/validation (python-jose/pyjwt).

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React TypeScript:** De facto industry standard for dynamic, component-based UIs, excellent for showcasing skills.
    *   **Vite:** For significantly improved developer experience (fast startup, Hot Module Replacement).
    *   **Chakra UI:** A comprehensive component library for rapid construction of a polished, professional-looking interface without extensive custom CSS.
    *   **State Management:** React's built-in Context API and Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for MVP-level state management.

### Deployment Strategy
*   **Platform Choice:** **Render** is the top recommendation for deployment. It offers excellent ease of use, generous free tiers for web services, background workers, PostgreSQL, and Redis, and native support for the application's distinct service types, perfectly mirroring the architecture. Vercel and Next.js are not accepted.
*   **Deployment Flow:** Involves building the React frontend into static files, provisioning separate services on Render (PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI Web Service, RQ Background Worker), configuring environment variables, and setting build/start commands.
*   **CI/CD:** Render's integration with GitHub provides basic **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**, automatically deploying new changes upon `git push` to the main branch.

### Role of AI Co-Developer (GitHub Copilot)
*   **Integration:** GitHub Copilot is a **core requirement** for the project, acting as a powerful pair programmer.
*   **Benefits:** Accelerates development, reduces boilerplate code, and serves as a learning tool. It can assist with boilerplate generation, complex logic generation, database queries, component generation, API calls, state management, debugging, and refactoring.

### Future Enhancements / Roadmap (Post-MVP)
The MVP provides a solid foundation for future development, aligning with the passion for automation and Notion:
*   **Notion API Integration:** Create a "Create Notion Page" action node, securely storing API keys and interacting with the official Notion API.
*   **Additional Service Integrations:** Expand the library of action nodes to include popular services like Slack (sending messages) or Gmail (sending emails).
*   **Scheduled Triggers:** Implement a "Cron" trigger node to allow users to run workflows on a recurring schedule, likely requiring a new scheduler process (e.g., using APScheduler).
*   **Real-Time Frontend Updates:** Enhance user experience with real-time feedback on workflow execution using **WebSockets** in FastAPI to push updates directly to the browser.
*   **Companion Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Build a CLI using **Typer** for managing the application from the terminal (e.g., triggering workflows, viewing logs, creating API credentials).
